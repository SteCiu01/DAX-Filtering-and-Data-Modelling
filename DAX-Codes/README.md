## 🧮 Overview

This repository is a curated collection of my most frequently used and production-tested DAX calculations.
It is designed as a reference library for building semantic models, to avoid going every time in previous models to retrieve old expressions.

Each code/use case is documented and organized by macro categories that I defined based on the code's nature and usage.

#### Control Measures: measures to use within the visual filters

| Topic | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Filter by Measures | Control measure that allows users to filter visuals by quantitative measures (e.g., Total Amount) | [Link](https://github.com/SteCiu01/DAX/tree/main/DAX-Codes/Filter-by-Measures) |

#### Virtual Table Measures: measures that relies on in-code virtual tables, and tat are used for complex/custom use cases

| Row Level Conditional Logic in Virtual Tables | Perform a logical calculation at a defined level of hierarchical granularity | [Link](https://github.com/SteCiu01/DAX/tree/main/DAX-Codes/Row-Level-Conditional-Logic-in-Virtual-Tables) |
